C sharp (C#), which is also called D flat (Dâ™­), is a black key on the piano keyboard. It is a half step (one key) up from C and a half step down from D which is how it gets its name. All sharps and flats are black keys and are named similarly.

C sharp is the first black key shown on the Preludio piano keyboard. By default, the W letter key on the computer keyboard will play C sharp. Try playing along now.
