A chord consists of multiple notes played at the same time. For this section, we will be looking specifically at triads, which are chords that have three notes. Major triads have a major third in between the first and second note and a perfect fifth in between the first and third notes. Every scale has three major triads: I, IV, and V. The I chord starts at the first note in the scale, the IV chord starts at the fourth note of the scale, and the V chord starts at the fifth note of the scale. In the key of C, these three chords are C major, F major, and G major respectively. Try playing the C major chord now (C E G).
