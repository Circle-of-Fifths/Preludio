Minor triads have a minor third in between the first and second note and a perfect fifth in between the first and third notes. Every scale has three minor triads: ii, iii, and vi. The ii chord starts at the second note in the scale, the iii chord starts at the third note of the scale, and the vi chord starts at the sixth note of the scale. In the key of C, these three chords are D minor, E minor, and A minor respectively. Try playing the D minor chord now (D F A).
